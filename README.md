# 🌟 Emotion Detection in Text using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building an **Emotion Detection system** that classifies text into different emotional categories such as *joy, anger, fear, sadness*, and more.  
It uses NLP preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to analyze textual input and predict the most likely emotion.
